    <h2>About F# and fsharpConf</h2>
    <div id="fsharp-logo-wrapper">
      <a href="https://www.fsharp.org"><img id="fsharp-logo" alt="F# Software Foundation" src="design/logo.png" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>F# is an open-source, cross-platform, functional first programming language. F# makes it
      easy to solve complex problems with simple code. It integrates smoothly with existing
      .NET code bases. And... it makes coding fun again! </p>

    <p>F# has an active open-source community building on a wide range of tools for web programming,
      data analytics, testing, cloud computing and much more. At <strong>fsharpConf</strong>, we
      want to bring some of the community together in a single-day online event!</p>

    <p>The <strong>fsharpConf</strong> conference is organized by the F# community<!--
      and is supported by the <a href="http://www.fsharp.org">F# Software Foundation</a> -->.
      The event is the third edition, following a successful <a href="2018/index.html">fsharpConf in 2018</a>
      and <a href="2016/index.html">2016</a>.
      It was originally inspired by <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/">dotNetConf</a> and we
      are excited to be continuing this great tradition of virtual events!</p>

    <h2>Recordings from previous editions</h2>
    <p>Can't wait for this awesome new content? Check out the great talks that we recorded
      at <strong>fsharpConf 2016</strong> and <strong>fsharpConf 2018</strong> covering
      quantum computing, Xamarin, Fable Docker, types and tests, the geometry of Abu
      Dhabi Louvre and much more!</p>

            <h2>Hedy: A gradual programming language for education</h2>
            <img src="photos/felienne.jpg" />
            <p>Everyone should learn programming, right? Yes! But how…? Felienne has recently developed a new programming language aimed at education, which she will introduce in this talk.</p>
            <p>Before presenting Hedy, Felienne will outlines the history of programming education and didactic beliefs in programming, as well as presenting an overview of how people learn in general, and how programming education could take lesson from cognitive science into account.</p>
            <h3>Felienne Hermans</h3>
            <p>Felienne is associate professor at the <a href="http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/">Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science</a> at Leiden University, where she heads the <a href="http://perl.liacs.nl/">PERL research group</a>, focused on programming education.</p>
            <p>Felienne was also one of the founders of the <a href="http://joyofcoding.org">Joy of Coding conference</a>, with a similar goal, which she organized for 6 years. Since 2016, she has been a host at <a href="http://se-radio.net">SE radio</a>, one of the most popular software engineering podcasts on the web. When she is not coding, blogging or teaching, she is probably knitting, running or playing a (board)game.</p>

            <img src="photos/mikhail.jpg" />
            <p>Feeling daunted creating cloud resources by clicking around in web portals or automating your deployments with scripts, YAML files, or JSON templates?</p>
              <p>In this talk, Mikhail will introduce Pulumi, an open-source tool that leverages programming languages to manage infrastructure, yet in a declarative manner! Using developer tools that you know and love, you can now apply unit testing, reusable architecture, deployment policies, and continuous delivery while provisioning resources in the cloud.
              Obtain the cloud superpowers while using F#!</p>
            <h3>Mikhail Shilkov</h3>

                    <h2>Probabilistic Programming: The What, Why and How</h2>
                    <img src="photos/maria.jpg" />
                    <p>f(x) = y, but y = 5. What’s the probability that x =1? Probabilistic programming is the idea of describing probabilistic models as programs, to then automatically infer how our beliefs about model parameters change given observed data. In recent years, probabilistic programming languages (such as Stan) have demonstrated the power of this approach by becoming the underlying tool behind numerous projects in social science, biology, genetics, astrophysics, and engineering.</p>
                    <p>But why haven’t such languages been more widely adopted yet? In this talk, Maria will talk about the nuts and bolts of probabilistic programming languages, addressing the challenges behind making these languages general-purpose, automatic, and efficient. In addition, she will discuss how ideas from programming-language research can be adopted in probabilistic systems, and how F# has helped her in the endeavour of bridging the gap between statistical modelling and probabilistic inference.</p>

                    <p>Maria is a PhD Student at the University of Edinburgh with broad interests range from programming languages and verification, to machine learning and human-computer interaction. More specifically,      she's interested in probabilistic programming languages, and in exploring ways of applying program-analysis techniques to existing PPLs in order to improve usability of the language or efficiency of inference. During her PhD, she has been working on these topics in relation to the probabilistic programming languages Stan and Edward2.</p>

                    <p>Having a good formatter for your source code seems like a well-established concept for many languages in these modern times. Prettier for JavaScript, for example, is a joy to work with. The formatting story for F# is a different one. There is a project called Fantomas, which was started in 2013 and sadly it lost its main contributor. Until it was rejuvenated in 2018 by a dynamic duo in the F# mentorship program. In this talk, I'd like to share my journey from my first pull request to become a maintainer of Fantomas. Discussing the technical aspects as well as the road to ownership.</p>

I will cover APRS and Ham radio, and how I used F# to implement the APRS specification. I will focus on the functional domain modeling aspects, which include designing by types and using active patterns to parse messages. My project is called Chickadee, is open source, and you can find it on GitHub. Features include a web UI built on Saturn, a map using Azure Maps, a background service, a CLI built with Argu, a test suite built on Expecto, and a build script using FAKE.</p>

                    <p>Do you or your clients ever have the question, "What would be the best course of action for us to take considering the options we have available and the restrictions we are under?" This is the question that businesses and clients are asking every day, sometimes multiple times a day. The good news is that there is an entire branch of Mathematics, Mathematical Planning, which focuses on this question and it is easier for developers to harness these tools than ever before.</p>
                    <p>Mathematical Planning is a powerful tool for decision making but has largely been relegated to use by experts. Recently it has been breaking out of its isolation due to great libraries becoming available for Python (PuLP and the Gurobi Python Library). Now the challenge is making sure your model is correctly formulated since Math cannot tell you if what you wrote makes sense.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, F#s powerful type system makes creating a Domain Model for your problem simple and straightforward. We will show that the F# type system and Mathematical Planning are a beautiful marriage and make asking the question, "What is the best plan?" a joy.</p>
